# expenses_tracker_frontend

Heroku deployment:
https://shrouded-atoll-95696.herokuapp.com/

Used React for the front end of this expenses tracker app, the user would create an expense category and then be able to add expenses to that category.
Utilized react bootstrap Accordion to present the categories and inside each category a table to present the expenses for that category.
This app would still need a user login function to be fully useful, and it will be added in the near future. 
each category and expense can be updated and deleted.
